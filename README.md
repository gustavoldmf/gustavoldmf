  ☀️ In the subjects of my course a heve the oportunity to do some jobs
  
  - A multiplayer tennis game in 2D using C
  Detais - -> This work was the first one I did and was a tennis game with the objective of
hitting a ball in the opposite direction to make a point, the game was built with a firmware named Allegro and
the knowledge involved programing logic with time and events with the challenge of updating the things that happen
while the game is being played.

  - A fight game using C++
  Detais - -> This work was called Folclore Kombat and we created a fight game simulating all the process of damage, protection,
 attacks,defenses, weakness and benefits to calibrate and program the characters, with this we do a system of attacks and
 defenses to become a champion, the code is in a repository in my profile.

  - A software of a dental clinic using PHP
  Details -> This work was proposed in the OOP subject and the objective of all of the development
is creating a backend of a odontological clinic using object-oriented programming(OOP), implementing all the features of a real clinic including the process of budgeting, treatment, execution and financial managment.
